# Revision 228/229
<sub>Aug 13, 2024</sub>

Dear community,

Canonicalâ€™s newest Charmed PgBouncer K8s operator has been published in the 1/stable [channel](https://charmhub.io/pgbouncer-k8s?channel=1/stable) :tada: 

Due to its mult-architecture support, PgBouncer charm releases two revisions simultaneously: 
* Revision 229 is built for `amd64`
* Revision 228 is built for for `arm64`

To make sure you deploy for the right architecture, we recommend setting an [architecture constraint](https://juju.is/docs/juju/constraint#heading--arch) for your entire juju model.

Otherwise, it can be done at deploy time with the `--constraints` flag:
```shell
juju deploy pgbouncer-k8s --trust --constraints arch=<arch> 
```
where `<arch>` can be `amd64` or `arm64`.

[note]
If you are jumping over several stable revisions, make sure to check [previous release notes](/t/12261?channel=1/stable) before upgrading to this revision.
