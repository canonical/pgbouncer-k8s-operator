# PgBouncer K8s Documentation

The PgBouncer K8s Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [PgBouncer](http://www.pgbouncer.org/) - the lightweight connection pooler for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/).

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. Consider to use [Charmed PostgreSQL K8s](https://charmhub.io/postgresql-k8s).

The PgBouncer K8s operator can deploy and operate on both [physical/virtual machines](https://github.com/canonical/pgbouncer-operator) and on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/canonical/pgbouncer-k8s-operator). Both flavours offer identical features and simplify deployment, scaling, configuration and management of PgBouncer reliably in production.
